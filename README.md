This feature will allow an administrator to add a book to a database or an author to a database

When any user searches by specified ID they can search for and get a book or a list of written books based on the author they have searched for.

So far, The administrator can add a book and an author.

Anyone can search for and recieve a book object by using the ISBN.

For now, a user can search for an author by an autogenerated author ID, this may change.
When adding a book to the list of authoredBooks the book does not save, this has to be debugged.
Then the system must return a list of authoredBooks, for now it is returning the list as well as a description of the author.  This will change to authoredBooks only.
